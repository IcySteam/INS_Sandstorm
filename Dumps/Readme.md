# [INS] Sandstorm Dumps

These dumps are for people that want to understand what running behind sandstorm.<br>
You can use these dumps to create your own config file like game.ini file.<br><br>

I did not put all the game.ini config because it too much for me to put every single one of them.<br>
You can explore the rest in these dumps and try figure out what to change in your game.ini file or other files.<br><br>

Start by searching up `Insurgency.INSCheckpointGameMode` then you will see the class then the other stuff in there with different variable types that actually exist in game.ini<br>
The rest is up to to figure it out how it work. NWI never put full documentation on every single config.
