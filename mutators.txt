Config-UNFRIENDLY mutators:
Frenzy: as of 1.4, MinMaxEnemies and MaxPlayersToScaleEnemyCount not working, default number of enemies spawn regardless; need to use gamemodeproperty RCon command every time before round starts to fix; desired enemy count: 8 per player and varies per mode
Vampirism: is NOT compatible with Ultralethal
Supply point mutators: they override Game.ini (e.g. InitialSupply, MaximumSupply) if used
